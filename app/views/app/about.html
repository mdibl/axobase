                    We are international group of researchers that are committed to empowerment of
                    axolotl and other salamanders for research purposes. For the last three years,
                    our community has gathered to hold meetings where we not only exchange
                    scientific progress, but also discuss issues that are necessary for the progress
                    of the field.
